Hosting site Backup Manager
======================================

This module adds a "Backups" tab to the "site" nodes in the 
Hostmaster environment. The tab shows the backups and enables
per backup actions (Restore, Delete and Get).


TODO:
- Check if there are tasks working with the backups to prevent "collisions"
